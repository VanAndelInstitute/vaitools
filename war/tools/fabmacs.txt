Simulation, molecular dynamics

Overview
fABMACS is a flexible adaptively biased flavor of GROMACSv5.0.5. fABMACS was developed to maximize scalability of adaptive biasing so that better efficiency can be achieved when simulation systems are distributed across a large computing infrastructure.

Download and Installation
fABMACS is available for download and use. Instructions and example inputs (for the ligand-protein system in the publication) are available as well. Please visit <a href="https://github.com/BradleyDickson/fABMACS">GitHub</a> to download.
