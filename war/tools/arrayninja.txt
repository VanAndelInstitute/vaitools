Overview
ArrayNinja is a portable, open source and interactive application that unifies the planning, visualization, and analysis of custom microarray experiments.ArrayNinja is distributed as a virtual machine (VM) that runs a local and private web server. Because the tools are packaged as a VM and utilize a web browser as a user interface, ArrayNinja is platform agnostic.

Install as a Virtual Machine
The ArrayNinja VM is built to use VirtualBox, which is a free tool for building and running virtual machines. VirtualBox must be installed before the ArrayNinja VM can be used. To download the ArrayNinja VM, visit http://research.vai.org/Tools/arrayninja . To run ArrayNinja, unzip the VM and load the VM into virtualbox. Once the VM is running, navigate your web browser to http://localhost:2080

Docker Installation
ArrayNinja can be run on linux platforms via a docker application. The docker can be found at Docker Hub and it can be installed by pulling bradleydickson/arrayninja.<br/>The docker app should be started with command:<br/>docker run -d -p 2080:80 bradleydickson/arrayninja
