Overview
TruSeq Methyl Capture EPIC (TruSeq EPIC) is a targeted bisulfite sequencing platform provided by Illumina. Combining bisulfite conversion with hybrid selection and deep sequencing, TruSeq EPIC can perform whole-genome DNA methylation profiling. We applied this new technology to biological replicates of human cell lines to assess its genome-wide CpG coverage, capture performance, accuracy, reproducibility and biomarker discovery ability.
